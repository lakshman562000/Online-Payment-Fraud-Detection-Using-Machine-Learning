# Online-Payment-Fraud-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
Online Payment Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning: A real-time fraud detection system leveraging machine learning algorithms to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions.

# Project Overview

This project leverages machine learning algorithms to detect fraudulent online payment transactions in real-time, enhancing customer security and reducing financial losses.

# Features

- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, data normalization, and feature scaling
- Model Development: Implementing machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks) for fraud detection
- Model Evaluation: Assessing performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Real-time Deployment: Integrating the model with payment gateways for instantaneous fraud detection

# Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- Frameworks: Flask/Django (for web deployment)
- Databases: MySQL/PostgreSQL (for storing transaction data)

# Dataset
